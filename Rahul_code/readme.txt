Overview
This project focuses on data analytics and data science. The objective was to explore various techniques and tools to analyze and derive insights from a given dataset. The project was divided into two phases: Introduction and Phase 1. This README document provides an overview.

Introduction:
Learnt basics of data science and data analytics and created ppt for that.

Phase 1
Week 1
During the first week of Phase 1, the team focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic hypothesis testing. EDA helps in understanding the dataset by summarizing its main characteristics. Basic hypothesis testing allows us to make inferences about the population based on sample data.

Week 2
In the second week, the team performed the following tasks:

CART regression: Classification and Regression Trees (CART) were used to build predictive models based on the dataset.
KS test: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was conducted to compare the dataset's distribution with a known distribution.
Pearson test: Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to measure the linear relationship between variables.
PCA: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
Week 3
The focus of the third week was on visualization techniques and creating a Tableau dashboard. Various visualization methods were employed to present the data in a clear and insightful manner. The team used Tableau, a popular data visualization tool, to build an interactive and informative dashboard.

Week 4
During the fourth and final week of Phase 1,the dataset were shuffled, We did time series prediction. The following algorithms were implemented:

Linear regression: A linear model was fitted to the time series data for prediction.
Logistic regression: Logistic regression was employed for binary classification tasks within the time series data.
Random Forest: A Random Forest algorithm was utilized to capture complex patterns and make predictions.
Decision Tree: Decision trees were employed to create predictive models based on the time series dataset.
Conclusion
Phase 1 of the project was successfully completed, covering a range of data analytics and data science techniques. The team gained valuable insights from the dataset by performing EDA, hypothesis testing, regression, statistical tests, PCA, visualization, and time series prediction. The outcomes of Phase 1 will serve as a foundation for Phase 2, where further analysis and advanced modeling techniques will be explored.
